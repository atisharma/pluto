# Pluto

Pluto is a graphical spectrum analyzer for Squeezelite and the Pimoroni unicorn hat HD, that pipes output from cava. Requires most recent cava master branch.

Many music. Much blinkenlights.


## TODO

- [ ] check font licence
- [ ] cava binary pipe instead of ascii pipe?
- [ ] scrolling LMS text?
- [ ] kid's pixel art
